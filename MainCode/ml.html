    <p> <h4> <center>Neural Network Model</center></h4>
        <div> <center>
            <br>
            Since neural networks are effective at modeling complex and/or non-linear relationships, we attempted to create a neural network model for our salary-prediction project.
            <br>
            <h5>Model Implementation</h5>
            We initially started by using a regression model on select features, which produced a highly ineffective model with extremely high loss and MSE.
            </center>
        </div></p>

    <p style="float: left;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jenny16x/TeamSix/alyssa/neural-network/images/NN1-MSE.png" height="300" width="300" border="20px"></p>

<div style="clear: left;">
    <p style="float: left;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jenny16x/TeamSix/alyssa/neural-network/images/NN2-loss.png" height="300" width="300" border="20px"><hr class="dotted"></p>
    <p>
        <div> <center>
            <br>
            To improve the model, we decided to peform a log-transformation on the Salary column in order to standardize the salaries in an attempt to help the model work better. We predicted that the wide variation/distribution in salaries for MLB pitchers may have contributed to the initial neural network's poor performance.            <br>
            <br>
            Using a log-10 transformation did improve the metrics for the neural network model significantly, however the loss and MSE were still very high- too high to be considered an accurate model.

    <h5>Results</h5>
            Due to the poor performance of the neural network model with our dataset, we determined that a neural network model was not well-suited for the purpose of our project.
            <br>
            <h5>Benefits & Limitations</h5>
            Some benefits of using a neural network model would be that they are often effective at modeling complex and non-linear relationships, and can weigh feature significance in a more sophisticated way than standard machine learning models.
            <br>
            A few major limitations of this model are:
            <ul>
                <li>Neural networks require significant data preprocessing; like a real brain, neural network models are prone to learning 'bad habits' when training, so thorough preprocessing is required to avoid this.</li>
                <li>Neural networks are highly customizable, so it can be difficult to determine the optimal structure for the neural network. We found that to be the case in our situation- where even after various attempts at optimization, some good and some bad, we were unable to produce an effective neural network model.</li>
            </ul>
        </center></p>

    <p><h4> <center>Polynomial Regression Analysis</center></h4>
        <div> <center>
            <br>
            Another model we explored using was a polynomial regression analysis. We thought it might perform better than a typical linear regression model given that many of the pitching statistics analyzed were only moderately correlated with pitcher salary. The polynomial regression model attempts to overcome this issue by adding a curvature to what would otherwise be a flat prediction line.            <br>
            <h5>Benefits and Limitations</h5>
            Some benefits to polynomial regression are that they work well on any size dataset, and they are effective at analyzing non-linear relationships.
            <br>
            Some limitations to this model are that outliers can negatively impact performance, and it can be difficult to determine the optimal polynomial degree for your dataset- and choosing the wrong polynomial degree will result in poor predictive power.
